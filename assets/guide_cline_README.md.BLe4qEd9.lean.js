These modified versions carry relatively shorter contexts, handle requests more smoothly, and have a higher cache hit rate, which can help save API call costs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use DeepSeek with Caution for Large Projects</strong>: For large code projects, it is not recommended to use DeepSeek + Cline. Large projects typically carry a large amount of code context, which can significantly slow down API request processing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Switch to Other LLM Providers</strong>: It is recommended to switch to other LLM providers when using Cline for a smoother experience.</p></li></ol><h2 id="roo-cline" tabindex="-1">Roo Cline <a class="header-anchor" href="#roo-cline" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Roo Cline&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="image"></p>',14)]))}const w=o(c,[["render",p]]);export{k as __pageData,w as default};
