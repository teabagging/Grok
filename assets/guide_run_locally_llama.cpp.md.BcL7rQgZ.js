However, this difference is crucial:</p><ul><li>Python is an interpreted language: The code you write is executed line-by-line on-the-fly by an interpreter. You can run the example code snippet or script with an interpreter or a natively interactive interpreter shell. In addition, Python is learner friendly, and even if you don&#39;t know much before, you can tweak the source code here and there.</li><li>C++ is a compiled language: The source code you write needs to be compiled beforehand, and it is translated to machine code and an executable program by a compiler. The overhead from the language side is minimal. You do have source code for example programs showcasing how to use the library. But it is not very easy to modify the source code if you are not verse in C++ or C.</li></ul><p>To use llama.cpp means that you use the llama.cpp library in your own program, like writing the source code of <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ollama</a>, <a href="https://lmstudio.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LM Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GPT4ALL</a>, <a href="https://llamafile.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">llamafile</a> etc. But that&#39;s not what this guide is intended or could do. Instead, here we introduce how to use the <code>llama-cli</code> example program, in the hope that you know that llama.cpp does support Qwen2.5 models and how the ecosystem of llama.cpp generally works.</p><hr><p>The main steps are:</p><ol><li>Get the <code>llama-cli</code> program</li><li>Get the Qwen2.5 models in GGUF[^GGUF] format</li><li>Run the program with the model</li></ol><p>Remember that <code>llama-cli</code> is an example program, not a full-blown application.

&gt; <span class="user">explain large language models in simple English</span>
Large language models are complex computer programs that have been trained to understand and generate human language. They are like giant dictionaries or thesauruses, but instead of just having words and definitions, they can understand the context, meaning and relationships between words. 

Imagine a really smart person who has read and understood every book on the planet. This person can understand what you are saying, know the meanings of words, understand the context, and even predict what you might say next. A large language model does something similar but it is based on algorithms and has been taught using huge amounts of text data. 

They&#39;re used in various applications like translating text, answerxng questions, writing stories, summarizing texts, detecting emotions in text, and even generating new text. These mdels are quite powerful but also quite complex and require a lot of computational resources to run.
</pre><p>That&#39;s something, isn&#39;t it? You can stop the model generation anytime by Ctrl+C or Command+. However, if the model generation is ended and the control is returned to you, pressing the combination will exit the program.</p><p>So what does the command we used actually do? Let&#39;s explain a little:</p><p>:<code>-m</code> or <code>--model</code>: Model path, obviously. :<code>-co</code> or <code>--color</code>: Colorize output to distinguish prompt and user input from generations. Prompt text is dark yellow; user text is green; generated text is white; error text is red. :<code>-cnv</code> or <code>--conversation</code>: Run in conversation mode. The program will apply the chat template accordingly. :<code>-p</code> or <code>--prompt</code>: In conversation mode, it acts as the system message. :<code>-fa</code> or <code>--flash-attn</code>: Enable Flash Attention if the program is compiled with GPU support. :<code>-ngl</code> or <code>--n-gpu-layers</code>: Layers to the GPU for computation if the program is compiled with GPU support. :<code>-n</code> or <code>--predict</code>: Number of tokens to predict.</p><p>You can also explore other options by</p><div class="language-bash"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">bash</span><pre class="shiki github-dark vp-code" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#B392F0;">./llama-cli</span><span style="color:#79B8FF;"> -h</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="interactive-mode" tabindex="-1">Interactive Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#interactive-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interactive Mode&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The conversation mode hides the inner workings of LLMs. With interactive mode, you are made aware how LLMs work in the way to completion or continuation. The workflow is like</p><ol><li>Give the model an initial prompt, and the model generates a completion.</li><li>Interrupt the model generation any time or wait until the model generates a reverse prompt or an eos token.</li><li>Append new texts (with optional prefix and suffix), and then let the model continues the generation.</li><li>Repeat Step 2. and Step 3.</li></ol><p>This workflow requires a different set of options, since you have to mind the chat template yourselves.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated algorithms designed to process and generate human-like text. They&#39;re trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet, books, and other sources, enabling them to understand language in various domains and generate responses that often closely resemble human output. LLMs can be used for various tasks such as language translation, text summarization, answering questions, and even creative writing. They are typically characterized by their size, with some models containing billions of parameters, making them quite complex and powerful.&lt;|im_end|&gt;
</pre><p>We use <code>prompt</code>, <code>in-prefix</code>, and <code>in-suffix</code> together to implement the chat template (ChatML-like) used by Qwen2.5 with a system message. So the experience is very similar to the conversation mode: you just need to type in the things you want to ask the model and don&#39;t need to worry about the chat template once the program starts. Note that, there should not be a new line after user input according to the template, so remember to end your input with <code>/</code>.</p><p>:::{dropdown} Advanced Usage</p><p>Interactive mode can achieve a lot more flexible workflows, under the condition that the chat template is maintained properly throughout. The following is an example:</p><pre class="terminal">...
=== Running in interactive mode. ==
 - Press Ctrl+C to interject at any time.
 - Press Return to return control to the AI.

A Large Language Model (LLM<span class="user">) is not what you think it is. It</span>&#39;s not just a model of the world like a globe or a map. It&#39;s a type of artificial intelligence that has been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. These models can be used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and even generating new text that is similar to a given piece of text. Some of the most well-known LLM<span class="user"> applications are not what you think they are. They</span> might include chatbots, content generation, and language translation, among others. The capabilities of these models are constantly expanding as researchers continue to improve and refine them.
&lt;|im_end|&gt;
</pre><p>In the above example, I set <code>--reverse-prompt</code> to <code>&quot;LLM&quot;</code> so that the generation is interrupted whenever the model generates <code>&quot;LLM&quot;</code>[^rp]. The in prefix and in suffix are also set to empty so that I can add content exactly I want. After every generation of <code>&quot;LLM&quot;</code>, I added the part <code>&quot;...not what you think...&quot;</code> which are not likely to be generated by the model. Yet the model can continue generation just as fluent, although the logic is broken the second time around. I think it&#39;s fun to play around. :::</p><p>[^rp]: There are some gotchas in using <code>--reverse-prompt</code> as it matches tokens instead of strings. Since the same string can be tokenized differently in different contexts in BPE tokenization, some reverse prompts are never matched even though the string does exist in generation.</p><h3 id="non-interactive-mode" tabindex="-1">Non-interactive Mode <a class="header-anchor" href="#non-interactive-mode" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Non-interactive Mode&quot;">​</a></h3><p>You can also use <code>llama-cli</code> for text completion by using just the prompt.

</span>Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated artificial intelligence models capable of generating human-like text. These models, trained on vast amounts of textual data, are designed to understand and generate text with varying degrees of complexity, including paragraphs, stories, articles, and even scripts. LLMs are trained using deep learning algorithms, often involving techniques like transformer architectures, which help them to learn the patterns and structures within language.

Some of the most prominent examples of LLMs are:

1. **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: Developed by OpenAI, GPT models are known for their ability to generate text that is difficult to distinguish from human-written text. There are several versions of GPT, including GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-3.5.

2. **Bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Developed by Google, Bert is another influential model that uses transformers for natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and question answering.

3. **LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications)**: Developed by Google, this model is designed for conversational applications, capable of understanding context and providing responses in a natural and coherent manner.

4. **T5 (Text to Text Transfer Transformer)**: Developed by Google, T5 is designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks by learning a universal representation of language.

These models have applications in various fields, including but not limited to, content generation, text summarization, code generation, chatbot development, and more. They can significantly enhance human productivity and provide solutions for tasks that were previously difficult or impossible to automate. However, they also raise ethical concerns about privacy, bias, and misinformation, emphasizing the importance of responsible AI development and deployment.&lt;|im_end|&gt; [end of text]
